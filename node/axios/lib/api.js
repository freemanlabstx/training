/* 
 * This is the base API layer for interfacing with
 * the chirp API. A couple things to be done here:
 * 
 * 1. Import the axios package. If you're unsure how to
 *    do that, try finding axios on GitHub and looking
 *    at the first line of the "Example" section.
 * 2. Use axios.create to create a custom API function
 *    that we can re-use in other files. To do this,
 *    call axios.create and pass in an object as the 
 *    argument to this function. Set "baseURL" to the
 *    variable url. Set this to the variable api.
 * 3. Make api the export for this module, by setting
 *    module.exports to api.
