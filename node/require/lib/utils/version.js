/*
 * Using `require`, load the file `configuration/data`, which is one directory
 * _up_ from the current directory (use ".."). Set this to data.
 *
 * Define the function loadVersion, which returns data.version.
 *
 * Also define the export for this file: module.exports should equal
 * an object with the key and value loadVersion (there is an ES6 shorthand for this!)
